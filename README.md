**Requirements

* Numpy
* OpenCV
* Haar.xml: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml

**Instructions:**
* Make a directory datasets in current project before running code.
* Run in a local python enviornment
* change name of person on capture.py as per your requirements. 

Its just a leaning excercise, you have to change the name in capture.py for new faces everytime.
